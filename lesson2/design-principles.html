       <!--White Spaces-->
        <div class="lesson2-grid">
           <section id="box-1">
               <h2 class="lesson2-headline-1">White Spaces</h2>
               <h3 class="lesson2-brand1">Apple</h3>

               <p class="lesson2-paragraph-1"> Apple is a well-known company, not only for its products but for its marketing. I think they did a great job on their website, illustrating a perfect example of “White Spaces” correct( and much needed) usage. Not only because they chose the color white as background color, but for the technique, they used to emphasize its colorful product. It makes us focus our sight on what really matters, by helping establish a visual hierarchy in their website. </p>
               <div class="lesson2-img1">
                   <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/?cid=OAS-US-DOMAINS-mac.com" target="_blank">
                   <img src="images/iMac.jpg" alt="Mac Web Page" width="250"></a>
               </div>
                   <p class="click1"> (Click on image to go to Mac Web Site)</p> 
            </section>

        <!--Repetition-->
        <section id="box-2">
            <h2 class="lesson2-headline-2">Repetition </h2>
            <h3 class="lesson2-brand2">Target</h3>
                  <p class="lesson2-paragraph-2"> When I was reading about this principle, Target was the first thing it came to my mind. I think most of us started to buy online during this time. Target is the place where I get most of my baby’s stuff. So I constantly check their website to do my online shopping. They change their design constantly, but not the whole structure. As you can see in the image below, you can notice the clear usage of Repetition. This principle states that a designer can choose anything from the design, and use it repeatedly to create a connection between all the elements that are in the website. In this case, you can notice the usage of blue (different shades) squares. If you check their website and scroll a little, you will notice it more clearly. As they use this principle repeatedly. </p>  
                  <div class="lesson2-img2">
                       <a href="https://www.target.com/" target="_blank">    
                       <img src="images/target.jpg" alt="Target web page" width="250"></a>
                      
                  </div>
                      <p class="click2"> (Click on image to go to Target Web Site)</p> 
                  
        </section>

        <!--Rule of Thirds--> 
        <section id="box-3">
             <h2 class="lesson2-headline-3">Rule of Thirds </h2>
             <h3 class="lesson2-brand3"><em>Coca-Cola</em></h3>
                  <p class="lesson2-paragraph-3"> I think Coca-Cola did a great job using the Rule of Thirds here. First of all, they used a beautiful, and accurate big image, which contributes to a more attractive design of the site. As you can see, the three cokes that the guys are holding aren’t right on the center of the image, but a little to the right. Just as the rule states, the fact of the main part of the image is not simply centered, but on a side, it gives energy and interest in the whole design.  </p>
                  <div class="lesson2-img2">
                       <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/" target="_blank">    
                       <img src="images/cocacola.jpg" alt="Coca Cola Web Page" width="250"> </a>
